/// This is especially useful in scenarios where video is dynamically added during a call.
/// Some endpoints (e.g., media servers or specific SIP infrastructures) expect that the callee
/// responds with a matching video track—even if inactive—to fully complete the SDP negotiation.

/// or lead to a one-way media issue (e.g., the caller sends video, but the callee does not properly receive or acknowledge it).
