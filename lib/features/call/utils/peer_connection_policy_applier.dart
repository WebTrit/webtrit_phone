/// Applies peer connection policies based on the provided [PeerConnectionSettings].
///
/// Specifically handles a use-case where a call starts as audio-only,
/// and video is added later through renegotiation. In certain SIP/WebRTC configurations
/// (e.g., PortaSwitch + Janus), the `recvonly` direction on the callee side does not trigger
/// video reception even if `m=video` and `a=sendrecv` are present in SDP.
/// To work around this, the caller includes a disabled local video track in the initial offer
/// when remote video is expected (`hasRemoteVideo == true`). This ensures that the `m=video`
/// is backed by an actual media track.
///
/// This behavior is controlled via:
///   `settings.negotiationSettings.calleeVideoOfferPolicy == CalleeVideoOfferPolicy.includeInactiveTrack`
///
/// **Important:**
/// - This class depends on [UserMediaBuilder] to acquire the local video stream.
/// - The added video track is explicitly disabled (`enabled = false`) to avoid rendering
///   or sending video until explicitly activated by the user.
